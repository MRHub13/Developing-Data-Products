## Introduction

Package 'gapminder' provides values for life expectancy, GDP per capita,
and population for 142 countries @ five years intervals in the period from 1952 to 2007. 
```{r setup, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
str(gapminder)
```

This course project application visualize positive correlation between duration of life expectancy & GDP per capita for each of 142 countries.

The presentation is generated with RStudio as a part of the Developing Data Products Course Project held on *coursera.org*

The Shiny application pitched by this presentation can be found @ https://mrshiny13.shinyapps.io/DDP_Course_Project_Shiny_Application/

The Shiny app source code is available @ https://github.com/MRHub13/Developing-Data-Products


## Application Overview

- application is written in Shiny - a web application framework for R
- source code consists of two files, *server.R* & *ui.R*
  - *server.R* covers the Shiny web application server logic  
  - *ui.R* includes the the user-interface definition
- application is hosted @ Rstudio's Shiny server in the cloud (*shinyapps.io*)

## 1. Left Panel of the Application

- **Title** labeled by default but user can modify the title 
- **Point size** a user can change the size of plot points 
- **Add best fiting (LM) line** can be applied 
- **Point color** different plot color can be selected
- **Continent** & **Country** can be filtered 
- **Life expectancy** interval can be selected on slieder
- user can download filtered data by using a **Download** button
